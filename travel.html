<h2>Speaking & Traveling</h2>
<br />

<p>I will be taking a break from speaking until October 2020. I do not plan on traveling until there's a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>(For more information on how to hire me to speak, <a href="http://cv.audreywatters.com/speaking">please read these guidelines</a>.)</p>
